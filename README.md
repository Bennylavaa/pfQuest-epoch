# pfQuest [Project Epoch DB]

An extension for [pfQuest-wotlk](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest/tree/wotlk) which adds support for [Project Epoch](https://www.project-epoch.net/).
The latest version of [pfQuest-wotlk](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest/tree/wotlk) is required and only enUS-Gameclients are supported at the time.

This project is meant as an example on how pfQuest can be extended for custom servers.
The database format in use, is similar to the existing pfQuest databases.
You might want to also look into the "pfQuest-tbc" databases to learn how entries could be removed or manipulated.
