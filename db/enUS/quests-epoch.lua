I can\'t spare any troops at the moment, but if you are truly desperate then I have an idea.\nSoutheast of Dun Algaz, where Loch Modan\'s waterfall from the dam ends, you will find Silverwind Cavern. We\'ve never sent an expedition team there because it\'s inhabited by ghosts, but these times call for unprecedented actions. Rumors say that in the cavern is a powerful ore, strong enough to make a blade almost indestructible.\nGo to the cavern, Bennylava. I will give you my strongest pickaxe, I trust you will take it with a brave heart. Should you return, bring the ore to Brak Durnad, our weaponsmith.
